# Python-code-helper
This is a table of python code and cases where the code can be used.

The codes are attached to use cases, such as questions which might be asked about a dataframe and which code may be useful in that scenario.  I made this table for myself as I had a hard time aquainting myself with the language.  Sometimes I didn't understand what was being asked of me, and further, deciding which python code was most appropriate for the question.  I wanted a visual table where I could see the code and questions together.
